# RigBox
Description: 
This tool is a rig helper. It's used in Maya to help with control objects and icon creation, and other basic rig construction tasks. The Curves Tool script contains commonly used features such as :
- Control objects creation, with various shapes to choose from. Creation of multiple objects at once.
- Colorizing options.
- Preset and custom attribute creation.
- Control clean up options such as zeroing out the curves using freeze transformations. Lock and hide made easy and quick!
This script was first developped by Jennifer Conley in 2012 and then by myself : David Saber, since 2022.


V4.03 : first public release since the Python re-write started:
With Maya 2025, the V3.x Pymel RigBox script does not run anymore. For my students, I had to speed up the developpment of V4.x, a full Python, non-Pymel version. I got the main tools up and running :
- curve creations
- curve coloring
- lock and hide
- object naming.
This is the first public release, the essential functions are working, but some others are not. I hope to restore all tools in the future.
